      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p class="bioText"> <b> Venn Diagram </b> : Displays a connecitno between two or more sets of data by using overlapping shapes, usually using circles, to display if a data sets relationship is inclusive, exclusive or are not related at all.  This is achieved by representing each area inside or outside the circles with a value that indicates the relationship(s).

      <br><br> <b>Types of Data </b> The Types of data that can be included is flexible.  As the examples above show, it can be colors, text, icons and interger which would represent the count of each circle or category.
      <br><br> <b> History of Venn Diagram </b> Who was the first to use it? His name was John Venn, who at the time was a lecturer at the University of Hull, teaching science and probability where he developed this new way of representing sets of data to be simplify the differentiation between one "data set" and another.  He wrote a book called <i> Symbolic Logic </i> in which he details his work.
      What other graphs is it related to or did it evolve from something else?  The venn diagram evolved from previous representation of where data relashionships like that of the Eurler model.  Here this method shows specific relashionships overlapp with a variety of data sets as opposed to the venn diagram that is much simpler.  It did this by displaying more general relashionships between data sets which all variables can be included.</p>
